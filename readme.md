Hey there...
The middleware or packages I have used in this project are:

1. Express
2. Mongodb
3. Cors
4. Dotenv



<!-- The react hooks I have used here. -->

1. useEffect
2. useState
3. useContext
4. useReducer
5. useCallback
6. useMemo
7. customHooks

I also have used the concept of private router for the access of admin and users separately.


<!-- Problem couldn't solve -->
Mongodb connection failure
